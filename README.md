## Problem
This problem consists in replicating a square fractal showcased in the Dynamic Systems 2022-2 class taught by Dr. [Victor de la Luz](https://github.com/itztli).

## Methodology
The problem was solved by subdividing itself into a pair of functions which can be applied recursively in order to solve the fractal. These two functions take care of drawing a square given a bottom left corner and the lenght of its side, and making use of that function to divide the square into another four.

## Instructions
Execute the "square-fractal.ipynb" jupyter notebook included in this repository.
